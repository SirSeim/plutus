Answer

### Problem 5.2
> Suppose you're building a phone application that lets you play tic-tac-toe against a simple computer opponent. It will display high scores stored on the phone, not in an external database. Which architectures would be most appropriate and why?

Answer

### Problem 5.4
> Repeat question 3 [after thinking about it; it repeats question 2 for a chess game] assuming the chess program lets two users play against each other over an Internet connection.

Answer

### Problem 5.6
> What kind of database structure and maintenance should the `ClassyDraw` application use?

Answer

### Problem 5.8
> Draw a state machine diagram to let a program read floating point numbers in scientific notation as in +37 or -12.3e+17 (which means -12.3 x 1017). Allow both E and e for the exponent symbol. [Jeez, is this like Dr. Dorin's DFAs, or what???]

Answer

### Problem 6.1
> Consider the `ClassyDraw` classes `Line`, `Rectangle`, `Ellipse`, `Star`, and `Text`. What properties do these classes all share? What properties do they not share? Are there any properties shared by some classes and not others? Where should the shared and non-shared properties be implemented?

Answer

### Problem 6.2
> Draw an inheritance diagram showing the properties you identified for Exercise 1. (Create parent classes as needed, and don't forget the `Drawable` class at the top.)

Answer

### Problem 6.3
> The following list gives the properties of several business-oriented classes.
> - Customer — Name, Phone, Address, BillingAddress, CustomerID
> - Hourly — Name, Phone, Address, EmployeeID, HourlyRate
> - Manager — Name, Phone, Address, EmployeeID, Office, Salary, Boss, Employees
> - Salaried — Name, Phone, Address, EmployeeID, Office, Salary, Boss
> - Supplier — Name, Phone, Address, Products, SupplierID
> - VicePresident — Name, Phone, Address, EmployeeID, Office, Salary, Managers
> Assuming a `Supplier` is someone who supplies products for your business, draw an inheritance diagram showing the relationships among these classes. (Hint: Add extra classes if necessary.)

Answer

### Problem 6.6
> Suppose your company has many managerial types such as department manager, project manager, and division manager. You also have multiple levels of vice president, some of whom report to other manager types. How could you combine the `Salaried`, `Manager`, and `VicePresident` types you used in Exercise 3? Draw the new inheritance hierarchy.
