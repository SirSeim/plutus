## 5.1 Introduction

_Plutus_ is a Stock Tracking Analysis & Prediction service which is an aid to investment in the stock market. Users have the ability to select stocks they wish to track and _Plutus_ will start to analyze the history it has on those stocks and create a schedule for the user to follow along with predictions of gains with associated probabilities of correctness. As a service, most of the software runs on cloud hosted servers that store stock information and analyze it. The user gets a web interface that interacts with this cloud infrastructure. Currently, the backend is a Node server with a Postgres database. This requirement is pending further exploration of the algorithms necessary for Stock analysis. Users of the _Plutus_ service can be analysts looking for another tool to base their models on. Another user could be just common traders that need aids to their investment strategy.
