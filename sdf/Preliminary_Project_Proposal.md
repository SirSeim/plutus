# 2.0 Preliminary Project Proposal

My proposed project is to have a stock tracking analysis & prediction service. It will automatically pull stock data on a very regular basis and correlate it to produce a trend function that will predict where the stock will go over time. This prediction will then be used to produce buy & sell and short & cover events that if followed have a calculated degree chance of producing a specific gain.
